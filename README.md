# DevOps
<p>
The term "DevOps" combines much more than just the work of two very well-defined processes in the IT area: "development" and "operations".</p>
<p>By combining these two processes, companies have managed to break down the barrier that divided these two teams.</p>
<p>Thus, the DevOps methodology includes approaches that accelerate the processes necessary to implement an idea that generates value for the user. For example, an idea can be a new feature, an improvement, or a bug fix.
DevOps also meets the demands of those who need resources most, offering independence and autonomy through self-service and automation.</p>
<p>The development and  IT operation processes work together through a Continuous Integration and a Continous Delivery process to accelerate the compilation, testing and launch of solutions with robustness and reliability.</p>
